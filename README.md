### Themes & Upcoming Releases

Under [Milestones](https://github.com/ktraunmueller/Compositor/milestones), you can find a list of feature _themes_ (_topics_, _epics_), together with milestones for the next upcoming releases. 

The **next release will be [1.5](https://github.com/ktraunmueller/Compositor/milestone/33), scheduled for September 18**.

## Example Files

I hope to collect some example documents and document templates over time.

### Example documents

Example documents can be used to explore the app's features.

If you would like to contribute example documents, please fork this repository and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

### Document templates

Document templates are skeleton files for creating new documents. They will be shipped with the app and listed in the "Choose a template" window (File / New).

If you would like to contribute document templates (articles, letters, reports, etc), please fork this repository and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
