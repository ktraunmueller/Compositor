# Welcome to the Compositor github repo
 
This repository contains

- a list of all open issues (both bugs and planned features)
- example documents and document templates

## Issues

Under [Issues](https://github.com/ktraunmueller/Compositor/issues), you can find a list of all known issues and planned features.

Please ignore issues with the label `internals`. These are reminders about internal things that I need to fix or check, and will probably not make much sense to you.

If you would like to report an issue, please send email to support@compositorapp.com with
- a brief description of the problem,
- a list of steps to reproduce,
- and, if possible, an example document with which the issue can be reproduced.

### Roadmap

The roadmap groups issues by release:

- [Release 1.0](https://github.com/ktraunmueller/Compositor/milestone/2)
- [Release 1.1](https://github.com/ktraunmueller/Compositor/milestone/3)
- [Later](https://github.com/ktraunmueller/Compositor/milestone/4)

Check the [releases page](https://github.com/ktraunmueller/Compositor/releases) for the latest releases.

## Files

I hope to collect some example documents and document templates over time.

### Example documents

Example documents can be used to explore the app's features.

If you would like to contribute example documents, please fork this repository and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

### Document templates

Document templates are skeleton files for creating new documents. They will be shipped with the app and listed in the "Choose a template" window (File / New).

If you would like to contribute document templates (articles, letters, reports, etc), please fork this repository and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
