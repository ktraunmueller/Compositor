# Welcome to the Compositor Product Roadmap
 
Note that this GitHub repository is a bit unusual in that it does not contain any source code. It's purpose is solely for **issue tracking**. 
The idea is to have the complete list of all known bugs, issues, and possible improvements out in public, accessible to anybody.
 
### Issues

Under [Issues](https://github.com/ktraunmueller/Compositor/issues), you can find a list of all known issues and planned features.

### Milestones & Themes

Under [Milestones](https://github.com/ktraunmueller/Compositor/milestones), you can find a list of feature _themes_ (_topics_, _epics_), together with milestones for the next upcoming releases. 

### Published Releases

Check the [releases page](https://github.com/ktraunmueller/Compositor/releases) for past and current releases.
