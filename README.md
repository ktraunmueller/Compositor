# Welcome to the Compositor github repo
 
This repository contains

- a list of all open issues (both bugs and planned features)
- example files and document templates

## Issues

Under [Issues](https://github.com/ktraunmueller/Compositor/issues), you can find a list of all known issues and planned features.

Please ignore issues with the label `internals`. These are reminders about internal things that I need to fix or check, and will probably not make much sense to you.

If you would like to report an issue, please create a ticket with
- a short but descriptive title,
- a brief description of the problem,
- a list of steps to reproduce,
- and, if possible, an example document with which the issue can be reproduced

after checking that no such ticket already exists. Or send email to support@compositorapp.com with the same information, and I will create a ticket.

## Releases

### Themes & Upcoming Releases

Under [Milestones](https://github.com/ktraunmueller/Compositor/milestones), you can find a list of feature _themes_ (_topics_, _epics_), together with milestones for the next upcoming releases. 

The **next release will be 1.1, scheduled for March 27**. The theme for this release is e-TeX, i.e., upgrading Compositor's built-in TeX engine to e-TeX (from TeX3).

For the foreseeable future, there will be regular releases every 4-6 weeks (depending on scope). For each release, I will select one theme to address, pick the tickets and bugfixes that shall go into this release and bundle them up into a release milestone.

### Published Releases

Check the [releases page](https://github.com/ktraunmueller/Compositor/releases) for past and current releases.

## Example Files

I hope to collect some example documents and document templates over time.

### Example documents

Example documents can be used to explore the app's features.

If you would like to contribute example documents, please fork this repository and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

### Document templates

Document templates are skeleton files for creating new documents. They will be shipped with the app and listed in the "Choose a template" window (File / New).

If you would like to contribute document templates (articles, letters, reports, etc), please fork this repository and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
